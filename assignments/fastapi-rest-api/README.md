# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to design and implement RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. You will practice creating endpoints, handling requests and responses, and working with data models.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ FastAPI Project Setup

#### Description
Set up a new FastAPI project and create a basic API server.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Create a main application file (e.g., `main.py`)
- Start the server and verify it runs locally


### 🛠️ Create API Endpoints

#### Description
Implement RESTful endpoints for a simple resource (e.g., `items`).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Define a data model for the resource using Pydantic
- Implement endpoints for:
  - GET (list all items)
  - GET (retrieve item by ID)
  - POST (create new item)
  - PUT (update item)
  - DELETE (remove item)
- Return appropriate status codes and JSON responses


### 🛠️ Test Your API

#### Description
Test your API endpoints using a tool like curl, HTTPie, or Postman.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Demonstrate successful requests and responses for each endpoint
- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., item not found)
